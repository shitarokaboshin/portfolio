Please place the image file named exactly: "mini donuts.jpg" (without quotes) in this folder.

This project expects the file to be available at `/assets/mini donuts.jpg` from the app root. If the file isn't present, the Hero component will automatically fall back to an online placeholder image.

Recommended: use a web-optimized JPG ~400-800px wide for best results.
